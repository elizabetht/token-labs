# Body Based Router (BBR) ConfigMaps — model-to-base-model mapping
#
# The BBR watches ConfigMaps with the label inference.networking.k8s.io/bbr-managed: "true"
# and uses them to map client model names to their base model.
# When a request arrives with "model": "<name>", BBR looks up the base model
# and sets the X-Gateway-Base-Model-Name header for HTTPRoute matching.
